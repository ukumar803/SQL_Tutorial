Temporary Tables in SQL Server
Temporary tables are special types of tables used to store data temporarily while a session or a procedure is active. 
They are very useful when you need to manipulate data in steps or hold intermediate results during complex calculations or joins.

Type                      Scope   Prefix   Visible To
Local Temporary Table    Session    #      Only the session that created it
Global Temporary Table   Global     ##     All sessions (until last session using it is closed)

Suppose i will create one temporary table from Employees Table

select * into #temp1
from Employees

Suppose i run normal select statement

select * from #temp1
it will give output in same window However when i open new window it will not work 

Now we will another table using ##
select * into ##temp2
from Employees

select * from ##temp2
it will give output in both window in same and new window.
