NOT Operator in SQL
The NOT operator is used to negate a condition, meaning it returns the opposite result of what the condition would normally return.

select * from Employees

--Q1.Display all employees whose first name is not 'Riya'
select * from Employees where not FirstName='Riya'

--Q2.Show all employees whose first name is not 'Riya' and whose salary is not 64,000.
select * from Employees where not FirstName='Riya' and not Salary=64000

--Q3.Display all employees whose first name is not 'Sharma'
select * from Employees where not LastName='Sharma'
